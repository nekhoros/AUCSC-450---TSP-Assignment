# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization and Multithreading

## Abstract

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a foundational combinatorial optimization problem with applications in logistics, routing, and operations research. This project leverages Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a bio-inspired metaheuristic, to solve TSP instances by mimicking the pheromone-based pathfinding behavior of real ants. To improve computational efficiency, the ACO algorithm was parallelized using OpenMP. Experimental results across multiple datasets—including Berlin52, 100-, 150-, and 280-point instances—demonstrate that the parallel implementation achieves substantial speedups, particularly for larger problem sizes. For example, the Berlin52 dataset achieved up to 4.26x speedup using 8 threads, while the 280-point dataset achieved a 5.00x speedup. Efficiency remained high at lower thread counts but decreased as more threads were added, especially for smaller problems—an expected outcome due to overhead and Amdahl’s Law. Overall, the results confirm that ACO maintains solution quality while benefiting significantly from parallelization, showing strong scalability and practical applicability for large-scale TSP problems.

## Introduction and Literature Review

### Introduction to the Traveling Salesman Problem

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical problem in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. It asks the following: given a set of cities and the distances between each pair, what is the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point? Despite its deceptively simple formulation, TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve all instances of it optimally. TSP has widespread applications in logistics, manufacturing, genome sequencing, circuit design, and more. Because of its computational complexity, TSP has become a benchmark problem for evaluating the performance of optimization heuristics and metaheuristics. Solving it efficiently—especially for large instances—remains an active area of research, particularly in the field of nature-inspired algorithms.

### Overview of Ant Colony Optimization

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based, probabilistic metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of real ant colonies. In nature, ants find the shortest path to food sources by laying down pheromones and following paths with higher pheromone concentrations. The ACO algorithm simulates this behavior by deploying artificial ants that construct candidate solutions based on a combination of historical pheromone trails and problem-specific heuristics, such as the inverse of the distance between cities in the case of TSP. Over multiple iterations, ants reinforce promising solutions by depositing more pheromone on successful paths while evaporation mechanisms prevent stagnation. ACO balances exploration and exploitation, making it effective for a variety of discrete optimization problems. Its modularity, adaptability, and effectiveness in finding high-quality solutions make it a compelling alternative to classical exact methods, especially in large or dynamic environments.

### Literature and Prior Work

The ACO paradigm was first introduced by Marco Dorigo and colleagues in the early 1990s. The foundational work titled "Ant System: Optimization by a Colony of Cooperating Agents" by Dorigo, Maniezzo, and Colorni (1996) formalized the Ant System algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on several combinatorial problems, including the TSP. Their approach used a probabilistic transition rule that combines pheromone intensity and heuristic visibility, along with global pheromone updating strategies. Since then, numerous variations of ACO have been developed, such as Ant Colony System (ACS), MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), and Elitist Ant System, each incorporating improvements in convergence speed, solution quality, or avoidance of stagnation. In parallel, researchers have explored hybridizing ACO with local search techniques (e.g., 2-opt) and applying it to large-scale industrial problems. In the context of parallelization, several studies have shown that ACO lends itself well to data-parallel implementations, particularly for tour construction, though shared memory contention remains a challenge during pheromone updates.
